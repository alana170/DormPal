Summary of Project: This is our team's project for the second semester FEH 1282.04 IBE-SI course project. DormPal is a website designed for college students to find roommates more efficiently and effectively. We spent the whole semester of this class developing the business model and pitch for this product. We refined our designs after conducting interviews with SMEs and end users. This was the creation of the UI for the website prototype after our 1-2 week sprint. Future developments include connecting to a database, programming the other features, connecting to the GPT extension, and gaining a user base.

Repo contents include all the .html files containing the website code, UML diagrams, Figma app prototype, video of functional testing, user documentation, and marketing materials.
